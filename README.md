# pixelfarm
PixelFarm, a challenge to create a realtime multiplayer game that is fully made with HTML5/CSS and JS that is controlled with a Gamepad. 

This is a project that I'm commiting to complete. It's to improve my knowledge on Gamepad use with browsers. I also aim to improve my knowledge about realtime interaction on the web and just in general.

Nothing is done yet and everyting is still in development phase.

This readme will be updated as much as needed. Code on.
